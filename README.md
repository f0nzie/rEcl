# rEcl

The goal of rEcl is to serve as a R wrapper of the class
`EclBinaryParser` in Python written by [Konstantin Sermyagin](). The
class converts the reservoir simulation output generated by Eclipse from
binary to dataframes.

## Installation

For the moment, `rEcl` is only available through Github. Once is
completed it will be submitted to CRAN.

## Requirements

  - R 3.5.3
  - Rtools 3.5
  - RStudio 1.2+. *I used RStudio preview 1.2.1327 for the development
    of the package.*
  - Python Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86\_64
  - Conda environment 3.6 with pandas and numpy installed. *I called
    this environment* `pyres`

## Files used for testing

For testing `rEcl` and `EclBinaryParser` I used the output binary files
from the reservoir simulation of the Volve field.

    VOLVE_2016.INIT
    VOLVE_2016.RSSPEC
    VOLVE_2016.SMSPEC
    VOLVE_2016.UNSMRY
