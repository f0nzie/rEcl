# rEcl

The goal of rEcl is to serve as a R wrapper of the class `EclBinaryParser` in Python written by [Konstantin Sermyagin](). The class converts the reservoir simulation output generated by Eclipse from binary to dataframes.

## Installation
For the moment, `rEcl` is only available through Github. Once is completed it will be submitted to CRAN.


## Requirements

* R 3.5.3
* Rtools 3.5
* RStudio 1.2+. _I used RStudio preview 1.2.1327 for the development of the package._
* Python Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86_64
* Conda environment 3.6 with pandas and numpy installed. _I called this environment_ `pyres`


## Files used for testing
For testing `rEcl` and `EclBinaryParser` I used the output binary files from the reservoir simulation of the Volve field.

```
VOLVE_2016.INIT
VOLVE_2016.RSSPEC
VOLVE_2016.SMSPEC
VOLVE_2016.UNSMRY
```
